//Trees - Collection of nodes and data connected with each other in singular form.
//Collection of Trees is called Forest.

//Binary Tree - The number of nodes can not be excided more then two.
//Number of Binary Trees without Identity = (2n C n)/(n+1)
//Number of Binary Trees with Identity = (2n C n)*n!/(n+1)
//Number of Nodes with Maximum Height = 2^(n-1)
